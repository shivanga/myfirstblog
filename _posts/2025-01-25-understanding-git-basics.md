Git is an essential tool for any developer. If you're just starting out, it might seem intimidating, but once you understand the basics, it becomes an invaluable part of your workflow.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code over time. Think of it as a sophisticated "undo" system that also allows multiple people to work on the same project.

## Essential Git Commands

Here are the commands you'll use most frequently:

```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Add files to staging area
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Check status
git status

# View commit history
git log

# Create a new branch
git branch feature-name

# Switch to a branch
git checkout feature-name

# Merge branches
git merge feature-name
```

## Best Practices

1. **Write meaningful commit messages** - Your future self will thank you
2. **Commit often** - Small, focused commits are easier to understand
3. **Use branches** - Keep your main branch stable
4. **Pull before pushing** - Stay up to date with remote changes

## Common Workflows

### Basic Workflow
1. Make changes to your code
2. `git add .` to stage changes
3. `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
4. `git push` to upload to remote repository

### Feature Branch Workflow
1. `git checkout -b new-feature`
2. Make your changes
3. Commit and push the branch
4. Create a pull request
5. Merge after review

## Conclusion

Git might seem complex at first, but mastering these basics will make you a more effective developer. Practice these commands, and soon they'll become second nature.
