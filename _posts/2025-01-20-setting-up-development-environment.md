A well-configured development environment can significantly boost your productivity. Here's my guide to setting up an efficient workspace.

## Essential Tools

### Code Editor
I recommend **VS Code** for its excellent extension ecosystem and built-in features:
- Syntax highlighting
- Integrated terminal
- Git integration
- Debugging support

### Terminal Setup
A good terminal setup includes:
- **Oh My Zsh** for enhanced shell experience
- **Homebrew** (macOS) or **apt** (Linux) for package management
- **Git** for version control

## Productivity Tips

1. **Learn keyboard shortcuts** - They save countless hours
2. **Use code snippets** - Create templates for common patterns
3. **Set up linting** - Catch errors before they become problems
4. **Automate repetitive tasks** - Write scripts for common workflows

## My Current Setup

```bash
# My favorite VS Code extensions
- Prettier
- ESLint
- GitLens
- Bracket Pair Colorizer
- Live Server
```

## Conclusion

The time invested in setting up your development environment pays dividends in increased productivity and reduced frustration. What tools do you find essential in your workflow?
